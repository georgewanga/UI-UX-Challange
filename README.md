# UI-UX-Challange
IoT Green house Challange
Project OverviewA client would like an IoT solution that monitors the growth process of their flower farm and eventually gives insights of methods that can be explored in order to maximize the growth potential of their farm. In order to achieve this the end solution needs to go through 3 phases:1.Capturing of data during the growth process2.Reporting3.AI integration to give predictions and patternsWe are currently in phase one.About the farm1.Each flower farm has several greenhouses called blocks each identified by a block number2.Each block is divided into several beds3.Each bed grows the same type of flower4.Each bed has a bed numberAbout the growth process1.Data about each bed is captured once every week2.We need at least 10 entries per bed3.Each entry comprises of a reading of a randomly selected flower4.Each flower entry has 3 major sections: Top, middle and base5.Each of these three sections need to be checked for:a.Health: water, nutritionb.Bugs:  caterpillars,  thrips,  meaty  bugs.  Each  bug  entryneeds  to  differentiate  between larvae and adults. The count of bugs found could be nil, < 10 or > 10Your challengeAs  a  UI/UX  designer  you  are  required  to  design  the  front  end  that  will  enable  to  capture  this  data effectively. You have the following constraints:1.Time limit: 48 hours from the time the assignment was given2.Technologies: HTML5, CSS3. DO NOT USE BOOTSTRAP OR ANY OTHER CSS LIBRARY. Images are permitted3.You are also required to submit a short task list in point form of what you are hoping to do as well as the time you think it will take to accomplish each task4.Assume that the only point of data capture will be a mobile phone hence only do a mobile design5.You do not need to complete all the designs required for the growth process6.Marks will  be scored  on  the  look  and  feel,  usability,  time  and  ability  to  follow  instructionsand how well you understood the above narrative7.Once completed please provide a Github link to your solution
